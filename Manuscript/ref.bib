    abstract = "{In the design of surveys, a number of input parameters such as contact propensities, participation propensities, and costs per sample unit play a decisive role. In ongoing surveys, these survey design parameters are usually estimated from previous experience and updated gradually with new experience. In new surveys, these parameters are estimated from expert opinion and experience with similar surveys. Although survey institutes have fair expertise and experience, the postulation, estimation, and updating of survey design parameters is rarely done in a systematic way. This article presents a Bayesian framework to include and update prior knowledge and expert opinion about the parameters. This framework is set in the context of adaptive survey designs in which different population units may receive different treatment given quality and cost objectives. For this type of survey, the accuracy of design parameters becomes even more crucial to effective design decisions. The framework allows for a Bayesian analysis of the performance of a survey during data collection and in between waves of a survey. We demonstrate the utility of the Bayesian analysis using a simulation study based on the Dutch Health Survey.}",

abstract = {Summary Recent survey literature shows an increasing interest in survey designs that adapt data collection to characteristics of the survey target population. Given a specified quality objective function, the designs attempt to find an optimal balance between quality and costs. Finding the optimal balance may not be straightforward as corresponding optimisation problems are often highly non-linear and non-convex. In this paper, we discuss how to choose strata in such designs and how to allocate these strata in a sequential design with two phases. We use partial R-indicators to build profiles of the data units where more or less attention is required in the data collection. In allocating cases, we look at two extremes: surveys that are run only once, or infrequent, and surveys that are run continuously. We demonstrate the impact of the sample size in a simulation study and provide an application to a real survey, the Dutch Crime Victimisation Survey.},
